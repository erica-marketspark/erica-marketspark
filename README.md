# Cradlepoint

We will be carrying Cradlepoint equipment in the near short-term and have researched options on how to integrate CradlePoint with CMDC-API to get status.

## Cradlepoint Docs

> Cradlepoint NetCloud Manager (NCM) is an SaaS-type server that enables the remote management of network devices, including routers and access points. This specification describes a RESTful API that can be used by web applications to access the service.

## Status Change Notification/Integration

Webhooks/Push notification abilities have not been provided by the Cradlepoint NCM API.

**Alternatives:**

- [Email Alerts](https://www.cradlepointecm.com/ecm.html#logs/alert_log) can be configured through the ECM UI with optional method to parse email using [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Parse_Webhook/inbound_email.html)

- Configure Routers Directly using Cradlepoint's Netcloud OS (NCOS SDK) to send push notifications

  > Cradlepoint’s NetCloud OS (NCOS) SDK provides the ability to customize the functionality of Cradlepoint devices with applications written in Python. Python applications written with the SDK are securely downloaded to the device and enabled using NetCloud Manager (NCM). Cradlepoint’s SDK allows for extending and enhancing the functionality of Cradlepoint devices, FOG computing, and managing IoT devices.
